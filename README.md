# Predictive-Modelling-using-R
The Loan Prediction Project focuses on developing a predictive model to determine the approval status of loan applications based on customer attributes. Using Kaggleâ€™s Loan Prediction Dataset, the project applies machine learning techniques to analyze key factors such as applicant income, credit history, and property area to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

This project involves data preprocessing, visualization, model training (using logistic regression), and evaluation to ensure accurate and reliable predictions. The findings provide valuable insights into how different financial and demographic factors influence loan approval decisions, helping financial institutions refine their loan policies and risk assessment strategies.
